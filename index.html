        Hello! My name is William Ornelas and I am from Michoac√°n, Mexico.
        Living on the coast, I have a deep appreciation for the ocean and all
        its wonders. I love swimming, going to the beach, and enjoying the
        beautiful scenery that my hometown offers. The sound of the waves and
        the smell of the salty air always bring a sense of peace and relaxation.
        Whether it's diving into the refreshing waters, building sandcastles
        with friends and family, or simply lounging on the shore with a good
        book, these activities always bring me immense joy and relaxation. The
        vibrant sunsets over the ocean are a daily reminder of nature's beauty,
        and I feel truly fortunate to call this place my home.
      </p>

          20 minutes from the pier lies this picturesque island. Its name means
          "Corn Silk." At its peak stands a 40-meter-high monument in memory of
          the Generalissimo Don Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n. Inside, the painter
          Ram√≥n Alva de la Canal depicted the life of the hero. The indigenous
          community that inhabits the island has largely preserved the
          authenticity of their customs, such as the Night of the Dead vigil, a
          ceremony where fishermen go out with their butterfly nets and boats
          illuminated with lit candles.
